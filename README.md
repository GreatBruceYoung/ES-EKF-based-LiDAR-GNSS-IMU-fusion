# Error-state extended Kalman Fiter (ES-EKF)-based LiDAR/GNSS/IMU fusion for trajectory estimation

This is a project that realizes LiDAR/GNSS/IMU fusion positioning based on ES-EKF. It can be used for indoor localization, autonomous driving, SLAM and sensor fusion. The core algorithm is illustrated below:

Note that this project is based and adapted on a course Coursera.

Usage: run _**main_fusion.py**_
